# Lokey recruitment task

This branch contains my first solution where I've done my own API, because I didn't read the statement to use existing API.
This repo contains my solution for recruitment task at Lokey.

## Task requirements:
- Use Quasar CLI
- Use compositionApi as well as defineComponent and setup()
- Typescript

## Task functionality:
Create simple solution with one view to perform CRUD operations. The view should contain **q-table** to list all **Articles** which can be edited and deleted. Above the table should be a small **q-btn**, which will open a popup to add a new **Article** and refresh table. CUD operations should also show a small alert with information about opetion success of fail.

Add "Release Date" to **Article** model and create/update GET endpoint to fetch only **Articles** from given year by parameter.
